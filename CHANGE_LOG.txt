v0.6-230330 (19th March meta)
stability greatly improved, danger analytics fixed, returning to lane fix, better defense, windranger added

> ADDED HERO Windranger
	-| Uses similar shot algorithms to Muerta for Shackle Shot, Powershot.
	-| Introduces improved kill shot selection, including prioritizing heroes with high KDAs if multiple are vulnerable and in kill range -- to be added to other heroes in the future.

> ADDED human player lane and role selection
	-| Set in the first minute of the match, respond to prompts by pinging your lane, then pinging top or bot for the desired role.
	-| Optionally you may respond in chat "top"..."3"

> Crash removed
	-| Fixed a crash that occured a bit less than 1/4 of the time a hero tried to deny themselves by dying to neutrals.
	-| No unexpected crashes since removing this over 8+ games.
	-| Project is now considered stable.

> Human laning, last hitting
	-| When near to a set of enemy creeps, the bot code will now automatically register and lock-in last hits it thinks the player would go for based on the players deduced or set role.
	-| Allies in lane will allow the player the last hit they expect they will take if the player is a higher role, but will take other enemy creep last hits if they are impossible / dying at the same time, as usual. i.e. a player can only lock-in one creep last hit at a time, and this allows others to take futher last hits.
	-| Allies will take last hits in lane if able and the player is further than an amount plus their attack range to that creep.
	-| When pushing behaviour is engaged, and allies are attacking high health creeps, they will probably continue to attack an arbitrary creep regardless of the player (arbitrary push target selection is temporary).

> More consistent behaviour
	-| Short tasks like using items, consumables, picking up items, port, using abilities, deagro towers, will now set the task they interrupted back to the top of the scoring priority once they are finished

> Dotabuff builds
	-| Fixed a bug where heroes who have unskillable additional abilities, like aghs shard abilities, would find their DotaBuff ability build broken and build automatically instead.
	-| Fixed dotabuff ability builds for heroes with unskillable / purchasable abilities. Lina, Sniper, Tide, Viper, and otherwise a few unimplemented heroes
	-| Added a bought boots more than once check (when creating item build data, not in-game logic), happens a bit. To be removed when build issue detection is more robust.
	-| **Arcane boots disassembling and likely other disassembling is not detected in resulting DotaBuff data. This will be fixed sometime later.

> Avoid leeching experience
	-| Bots now incentivise returning to their lane over time increasing.
	-| Based on the futility of fighting in their current area when they're not in their designated lane, and have not broken the power/gamestate seal of being soft locked to their role's lane.
	-| e.g. a core would feel "go away, you are only leeching experience" vs "nice gank"
	-| Reduces with time, usually enough time to force a TP back to lane, or running across to the designated side of the map.
	-| New code does not prevent approaching the wrong lane

> Danger analytics improved
	-| Fixed a bug that caused bots to think enemies moved at about 2100 movement speed while fogged
	-| Bots will become slightly more careful at the correct time based on missing enemies and the time they went fogged.
	-| Bots will not randomly become careful for a moment a few seconds after enemies disappear from other lanes.
	-| Better analytics for bots required for a safe bounty rune get, safe tower defense.
	-| Prevents random over-teleporting to towers.

> Skittishness
	-| Fixed a bug that caused heroes to think runes were more valuable than destroying an enemy ancient when allies outnumbered enemies in any nearby fight.

> Fixed selection of ability and mana use
	-| Due to a bug, bots after leveling up one time considered their mana-tempo to be infinite, as if they would never run out
	-| Bots now correctly use abilities based on various metrics per-ability, usually their own health percent, and their target-if-targetting's health percent, whichever is lower.
	-| Bots will use regular nukes, stuns and slows quite freely when high mana. Logic for avoiding waste of large cooldown abilities is usually handcrafted.

> Improved teamplay
	-| Fixed a bug that caused bots to gain score for considering moving to lanes that dead allies were previously in.

> Improved defending ancient
	-| Fixed a bug that caused a lock on defending ancient aggressively and also some bots failing to check buybacks if a lower role bot had bought back, had the gold for buyback, but was dead.

> Improved pushing
	-| Bots now better detect when it is safe to push enemy creeps under a tower. They may over-push and take more tower damage on occasion.
	-| This should help with bots who leave from an easy T3 push.

> Improved last hitting while pushing
	-| Cores are more likely to stop attacking an arbitrary creep if a last hit is nearby when pushing.

> Modified hero power analytics
	-| Increased the maximum KDA factor of hero power. Bots will be more reluctant to fight heroes with high KDA until they think they have a good enough fight (allies contributing)
	-| Bounty rune collection and tower defense will require more bot cooperation when defending against high KDA players/bots. (greedy bots can reject defense to continue farming, now high KDA players will attract more attention when pushing).
	-| If the bots cannot gather a strong enough defense they may abandon the tower defense task altogether, as usual.
	-| A lack of remaining mana percent is also now slightly more weighted towards a loss of power.

> Improved response to early game pushing
	-| The soft-lock that attempts to prevent players from not farming in traditional role lanes has had it's requirements changed
	-| If a player is over level 3, in addition to other checks, the lowest tier 2 team tower's health reduces the physical combat efficacy requirement to lane freely.
	-| Bots will not attempt to stay in their designated lanes when a T2 has been destroyed.

> Improved fight analytics
	-| Fixed a bug where heroes casting a spell on a player allied to them would invalidate their intended fight target data and target focus intensity data.

> Added muted check for using items

> Clockwerk
	-| Players picking Clock was broken in the previous release and has been fixed thanks to player feedback.

> Meepo
	-| Players picking Meepo was also broken, now fixed.

> Abaddon
	-| Fixed strange behaviour when trying to cast mist coil on himself.
	-| Will save allies with Q and W, allies with W have fight behaviour slightly incentivised to use the shield.

> Entrantress
	-| Sproink is now actually working, but is probably overused when being aggressive due to flip states, indicating activity type bugs (aggressive mode task dip-outs).
	-| May be a bug with finding the right facing direction before using.

> Defiler
	-| Fixed overuse of crypt swarm on creeps while pushing and feeling safe

> Improved channelled spell behaviour
	-| Fixed a bug causing most channel spells to only last 1 second.
	-| Cancellation of spells is coded per-hero, but otherwise will channel until the completion of the cast.

> Player hero picking
	-| Provided the load calls in unimplemented hero files. This allows the bots to load the DotaBuff data for any hero, including all the heroes the bots cannot play, this should improve lane selection.

> Untested heroes
	-| Along with loading all DotaBuff hero data, if a hero is loaded that is untested, an alert will show, but the game should continue as normal, with them either never using abilities or acting silly.

> Reduced unexpected application behaviour due to movement and checking unseen units data
	-| Potentially increased stability by reducing the instances of moved-off-the-map commands and checking enemy building data out-of-vision.
	-| A 3D scalar multiply was being used on basic movement vector adjustment functions, sometimes causing the hero to try to move to +-infinity height.
	-| May reduce or remediate the ~1/4 games that crashed in testing.
	-| Reduced console output (performance increase, especially if the user runs in developer mode)
	-| Cached copies of static spawner data.

> Jungle item management
	-| Bots will now trade jungle items up for higher tier items.
	-| They may grab additional jungle items and drop items for allies if they need a higher tier.
	-| If they are holding additional jungle items they will drop them whenever they are in the fountain.

> Experimental junk item selling added
	-| Has been in the code for a while, it "works" now.
	-| Definitely bugs.

> Other hero and gameplay tweaks

DEVELOPER:
> Made a plotting script to create math equation fits to game data and speed up patches for future map changes.
	-| top, mid, and bot lane detection of map locations improved, this is also used for players to communicate their lane and role.

> Added license prefix to source files

v0.5-230317 (11th March meta)
Improved combat, increased tempo, improved item use, muerta

> Added fast picking command '/all !fast' in chat

> ADDED HERO: Muerta
	-| Finds shots based on the average shot value she sees while able to shoot, scoring for accuracy, hitting two, hitting fighting intent target, getting a fear (tree shots), and reducing the shot length to disallow dodging
	-| The Calling usage unfinished
	-| Physical damage incoming detection may be bugged for triggering ultimate.
	-| Does not yet know she may attack ethereal units
> ADDED TEST HERO: Tidehunter
	-| Generic ability use (based on ability flags, cast at targets intelligently, but the abilities are not hard-coded)

> Enchantress
	-| Sproink is now used defensively

> Many other hero tweaks

> Fixed a location data bug that made bots sometimes think one enemy was in at the location which was an average of the locations of enemies nearby 
	-| Improved aggressive fighting
	-| Improved early game laning and early game group fighting
	-| Less shaky movement during and before fights
	-| More accurate danger/safety assessment

> Fixed heroes being picked multiple times

> Buyback: Added simplistic check, has false positives and surious behaviour after buying back, like teleporting to a place not related to the objective/fight under pressure

> Fort under attack: Heroes may become ridiculously aggressive when the fort is under attack. Temperory behaviour, but better than wandering.

> Jungle abilities: Added simplistic jungle ability handling, e.g. doom secondary abilities

> Push: Fixed a bug with game pausing reducing push scores when enemy creeps are not visible in the lane

> Push: Fixed a bug where towers that weren't visible would lock heroes into an impossible push task, immobilizing them, mainly/only on Tier-1s.

> Map positioning and grand strategy: When choosing a good lane to aim to operate in, bots now take more care of each other,
	flip flop less, push as a team, and cores may push alone if the lane seems safe.

> Increased use of danger analysis for avoiding farming behaviour

> Introduced some bugs where heroes will TP to the wrong lane in the early game

> Enabled the use of force staff (only hurricane pike was enabled)

> Will now sometimes use force_staff/hurricane_pike aggressively with direct movement

> Very basic soul_ring use, tries to avoid any unwanted health loss

> Reduced tendancy of returning to fountain when low health if not in immediate danger or expected danger and more enemy players are dead than allies

> Boots are now evaluated as much more valuable for selling junk

> Fixed a bug where only one tower at a time were able to be known as safe to attack without drawing agro. Technically if an allied creeps close to other creeps is attacking a shrine like an idiot while the rest of the set attacks a tower, it may cause the tower to be missed, but screw that creep anyways

> Added some test increases to pushing behaviour when enemies are dead.

> Many other minor fixes and tweaks. Some are test behaviour and might be changed back or removed, like jungling while pushing a lane with teammates.

> Stability: Application crash every so often.

> Updated meta
