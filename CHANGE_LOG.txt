Improved combat, increased tempo, improved item use, muerta

> Added fast picking command '/all !fast' in chat

> ADDED HERO: Muerta
	-| Finds shots based on the average shot value she sees while able to shoot, scoring for accuracy, hitting two, hitting fighting intent target, getting a fear (tree shots), and reducing the shot length to disallow dodging
	-| The Calling usage unfinished
	-| Physical damage incoming detection may be bugged for triggering ultimate.
	-| Does not yet know she may attack ethereal units
> ADDED TEST HERO: Tidehunter
	-| Generic ability use (based on ability flags, cast at targets intelligently, but the abilities are not hard-coded)

> Enchantress
	-| Sproink is now used defensively

> Many other hero tweaks

> Fixed a location data bug that made bots sometimes think one enemy was in at the location which was an average of the locations of enemies nearby 
	-| Improved aggressive fighting
	-| Improved early game laning and early game group fighting
	-| Less shaky movement during and before fights
	-| More accurate danger/safety assessment

> Fixed heroes being picked multiple times

> Buyback: Added simplistic check, has false positives and surious behaviour after buying back, like teleporting to a place not related to the objective/fight under pressure

> Fort under attack: Heroes may become ridiculously aggressive when the fort is under attack. Temperory behaviour, but better than wandering.

> Jungle abilities: Added simplistic jungle ability handling, e.g. doom secondary abilities

> Push: Fixed a bug with game pausing reducing push scores when enemy creeps are not visible in the lane

> Push: Fixed a bug where towers that weren't visible would lock heroes into an impossible push task, immobilizing them, mainly/only on Tier-1s.

> Map positioning and grand strategy: When choosing a good lane to aim to operate in, bots now take more care of each other,
	flip flop less, push as a team, and cores may push alone if the lane seems safe.

> Increased use of danger analysis for avoiding farming behaviour

> Introduced some bugs where heroes will TP to the wrong lane in the early game

> Enabled the use of force staff (only hurricane pike was enabled)

> Will now sometimes use force_staff/hurricane_pike aggressively with direct movement

> Very basic soul_ring use, tries to avoid any unwanted health loss

> Reduced tendancy of returning to fountain when low health if not in immediate danger or expected danger and more enemy players are dead than allies

> Boots are now evaluated as much more valuable for selling junk

> Fixed a bug where only one tower at a time were able to be known as safe to attack without drawing agro. Technically if an allied creeps close to other creeps is attacking a shrine like an idiot while the rest of the set attacks a tower, it may cause the tower to be missed, but screw that creep anyways

> Added some test increases to pushing behaviour when enemies are dead.

> Many other minor fixes and tweaks. Some are test behaviour and might be changed back or removed, like jungling while pushing a lane with teammates.

> Stability: Application crash every so often.

> Updated meta
