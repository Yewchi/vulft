-- Other modules can register their data as objective locations, when an enemy
-- 		disappears from the map, use these objectives, and their difficulties along with
-- 		enemy expected capabilities to determine where they might go. Just as a player
-- 		may say "A Radiant Terrorblade was solo pushing Dire bot T2. They left the tower
-- 		and walked towards the jungle, so they went to farm jungle or left for radiant's
-- 		jungle, because they can't really farm the ancient camp. If they're dawdling,
-- 		they probably have another Radiant hero nearby."
